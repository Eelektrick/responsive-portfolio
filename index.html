                My Name is Corey Post, I am a soon to be father of 2. My oldest is Clara Grace and she is 3, way too much energy and my little shadow.
                My second one, Carter David, is due first week of August and I am hoping he will be as easy as my daughter. I have been with my wife for 
                5 years and married for a little over a year.
                <br>
                I am currently intersted in a career change from working on vehicles all my life to something that interests me alot. Programming is very unique
                and I enjoy learning something new from it everyday. I started this journey going back to college at Weber State but I was only able to take classes 
                part time and was taking too much time, When I found this program to be able to learn the programming languages I enjoy and have a great network in 
                helping me find a new career all in a year is very hard to pass up on. I hope with all the guidance I have received to this point and in the future 
                will help me pass this program receive a job offer and not dissappoint everyone who has invested into me.

                My hobbies include playing video games on my computer, continuing learning how to be a future full stack deeveloper, and spending time with my family 
                when I have the free time from my homework. I enjoy watching professional played video games such as: CSGO, LOL, Smite, and RS6. I also enjoy traditional sports
                as well, my favorite teams are: Chicago Cubs and White Sox in the MLB, Notre Dame Fighting Irish in college football, and Chicago Blackhawks in hockey.
                <br>
                My goal is to take all the knowledge I have gained from college and the full stack bootcamp and translate it to a new career as soon as I graduate. I am not necessarily
                looking to be the best but more that I can show future employers that I can be hired and be able to contribute right away with little to no guidance.
