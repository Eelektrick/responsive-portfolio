Responsive Portfolio for homework #2.
[`Screen shot of index.html`](assets/index.png)
My 3 files are: [`main index page`](index.html), [`webpage to show portfolio`](porfolio.html) and [`contact me for more questions`](contact.html).
I have attached css files to all 3 with also bootstrap added in as well.
I made so all 3 files are responsive on size difference of the screen or window depending on user preference.

For me personally this was a challenge due to trying to figure out bootstrap and how to set it up to the html page and add some extra css to make the final product,
however I enjoyed the challenge to have another option in building websites.
